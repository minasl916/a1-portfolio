--Readme document for *MINA LI*, *minasl@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

9.5/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 1.5/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
        - images with descriptive alt attributes
        - appropriate headings and paragraph text
        - links to external pages
        - multiple pages with appropriate navigation between them
        - custom icons were made through Canva

(b) CSS features
        - modified padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
        - modified navigation link text color to be visually appealing
        - leveraged Bootstrap CSS helpers to display content in a more interesting manner (grids, circle images, etc.)
        - added custom fonts from Google fonts to add more personality (appropriate fallbacks are included)

(c) Advanced features
        - created a more complex page layout by including a navigation bar 
        - leveraged nested selectors to specify format

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
        No specific warnings or errors presented by accessibility checks through AChecker were ignored.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
        I took approximately 10 hours to complete this project.
